## About
We have received numerous requests about bringing support for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS sooner. This repo will be the home for testers, before official support will be delivered by us.

## Installation
All you need to start with Webmin on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS is to install custom "python" package that contains a symlink to "/usr/bin/python3" binary and to start with Virtualmin, you would need to install all other "dummy" packages and run slightly modified install script.

## License
